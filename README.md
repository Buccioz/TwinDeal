# -----Cryptcat-----
Cryptcat is the standard netcat enhanced with twofish encryption with ports for WIndows NT, BSD and Linux. Twofish is courtesy of counterpane, and cryptix.
TCP/IP swiss army knife extended with twofish encryption - Cryptcat is a simple Unix utility 
which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol while encrypting the data being transmitted. 
It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. 
At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, 
since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities. 
# -----Ngrok-----
Ngrok is a reverse proxy that creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to a locally running web service. 
Ngrok captures and analyzes all traffic over the tunnel for later inspection and replay.
